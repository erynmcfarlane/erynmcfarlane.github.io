Currently, I’m trying to put new projects on my github as I work on them, but prior to 2021, I was publishing static code on my figshare. Of course, before I got a bit more organized, I published data and code on a paper by paper basis. Please don’t hesitate to contact me for code or data from any of my published papers, or anything else you might see me mention. I’m always happy to help!
