                  <h3>S. Eryn McFarlane, PhD </h3>
              <p> I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in speciation in wild systems. I use quantitative and population genetics and genomics to answer questions about hybridization, reproductive isolation, and competition. I combine empirical field work with theoretical research, specifically individual based simulations, to better understand what happens when closely related species come into secondary contact. </p> 
               <p> I am currently an Assistant Professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. Previously, I did a postdoc in <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/buerkle/">Alex Buerkle’s lab</a> at the University of Wyoming, and a postdoc in <a href="https://pemberton.bio.ed.ac.uk/home">Josephine Pemberton's lab</a> at the University of Edinburgh.</p>  
             <p> I did my PhD on the interplay between Speciation and Metabolic rate in <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/department/ecology-and-genetics/research/animal-ecology/qvarnstrom-lab">Anna Qvarnström's lab</a> at Uppsala University in Sweden, and my undergraduate and MSc work with <a href="https://www.mcadamlab.ca/">Andrew McAdam</a> at the University of Guelph.<br>
                  When I'm not thinking about research or teaching, I'm chasing my kid or fur kids around, hiking, kayaking, birdwatching, or sports-watching (and rarely, sports-playing). </p>

                    <p>I'm a PhD student with a background in invasive species ecology and an MEnvSc from the University of Toronto Scarborough. A field ecologist at heart, I started my PhD counting grass plants in the prairies, but have recently been dipping my toe into the vast ocean of population genetics. My research focuses on rough fescue grasses (<i>Festuca hallii</i> and <i>F. campestris</i>), their fungal friends (<i>Epichloë</i> endophytes), and the possibility that the two grasses may be hybridizing.
When I'm not writing my thesis, you can find me wandering the woods in search of wildflowers, mushrooms, and birds, or at home trying out a new dessert recipe and winding down with a good video game. </p>

I don’t have my own thesis yet, so I am basically a helper in the lab right now and mainly work on the Butterfly (Colias) project with Amanda. We caught Colias around the GTA during the flying season from May to October. In my free time, I love traveling around and experiencing new things. I also love playing piano during my leisure time.</p>

I like animals, genetics, molecular genetics, evolution and very curious about hybridization when i got into evolution class, which drove me to be in the lab. If you don’t see me writing, I am probably swimming, lifting in the gym, singing in a choir at church, or binging on a korean legal drama.</p>

I am a BIOL 4000 thesis student in the StatsGen lab, conducting my project on fescue grasses (Festuca hallii and F. campestris) and their hybrids. My research investigates whether morphological traits can reliably distinguish hybrid individuals from parental species by integrating phenotypic measurements with genomic data. When I’m not measuring grass traits, you’ll find me chasing the perfect iced coffee ratio or curled up in a corner with a book, pretending it counts as a “literature review”.</p>
