<p>Unfortunately, my scheduled presentation to the Undergraduate Zoological Society at the University of Edinburgh (18th March, 2020) needed to be cancelled because of COVID-19. Stay safe everyone and flatten the curve!</p>

<p>On December 5th, 2018, I was excited to be part of a program called 'Biology Pupils in University of Edinburgh labs'. It was described to me as high school students speed meeting scientists. I had one minute to introduce myself, and then five minutes to have a conversation with three students about the biology that I do, and the biology that I'm interested in. I was a bit worried, because I'm supposed to have a prop (admixing pedigree diagram?), and describe my normal day as a scientist. I think it went well, and hopefully the students have a different vision of what a scientist looks like and does day to day (aka yelling at a computer).</p>

<p>On May 14th, I presented at the Pint of Science Festival, describing my research of hybridization and speciation processes in red deer and sika in Scotland. This was held at the Safari Lounge in Edinburgh. It was a great night discussing genetics, policy and conservation. With any luck, folks there will never look at a 'red' deer the same way again.</p>

<p>In April, Lucy Peters (@luce_peters) and I presented "Oh deer, oh deer" with the University of Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh International Science Festival. We had five great days of measuring antlers, and using pom poms to talk about introgression and hybridization. I had a total blast, and I suspect that some kids will now look pretty carefully at all of the deer they see, searching for signs of sika-introgression, and trying to guess deer ages based on antler length.</p>

  <p>Additionally, I have been part of a penpal program called Letters to a Pre-scientist. Between 2015 and 2018, I had a different middle school pen pal each year. We exchanged letters back and forth throughout the school year, and chatted about science, what it's like to be a scientist, and any other questions about science, research and school that they might have. I really love this program, and hope to continue participating in the future.</p>
