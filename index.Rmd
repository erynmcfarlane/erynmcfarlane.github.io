I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in speciation in wild systems. I use quantitative genetics and genomics to answer questions about hybridization, reproductive isolation, competition and physiology. I combine long term field monitoring with experiments done in the wild to better understand what happens when closely related species come into secondary contact.

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Alex Buerkle's lab][CAB] at the University of Wyoming. My current research aims to integrate empirical data (from the Scottish Red deer x sika hybrids project) with simulations to make recommendations about best practices for statistics in evolutionary genetics.

My previous work was as a Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr√•det) International Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, with collaboration with Lund University. I worked on red deer and sika hybridization in Scotland, as part of [Josephine Pemberton's][JP] research group.
