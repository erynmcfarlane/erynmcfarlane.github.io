I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in speciation in wild systems.
I use quantitative genetics and genomics to answer questions about
hybridization, reproductive isolation, competition and physiology. I
combine long term field monitoring with experiments done in the wild to
better understand what happens when closely related species come into
secondary contact.

I’m currently a postdoctoral researcher in [Alex Buerkle’s
lab](http://www.uwyo.edu/buerkle/) at the University of Wyoming. My
current research aims to integrate empirical data (from the Scottish Red
deer x sika hybrids project) with simulations to make recommendations
about best practices for statistics in evolutionary genetics.

My previous work was as a Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet)
International Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, with
collaboration with Lund University. I worked on red deer and sika
hybridization in Scotland, as part of [Josephine
Pemberton’s](https://pemberton.bio.ed.ac.uk/home) research group.
